Original code by Platyping.[PARAGRAPH:2]In Caveman2Cosmos the Religion techs are World Techs that only one nation can research. This is because those techs are both dead end and one shot techs and this was the only way to ensure the AI nations did not waste research on those already discovered.</English>
